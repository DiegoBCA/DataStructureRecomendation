# Data Structure Illustrations Catalog

This document collects the visual representations (ASCII Art) generated by the system to help the user understand the architecture of each recommended data structure.

## 1. Linear Structures

### Array
Represents a block of contiguous memory where elements are directly accessible via numerical indices.
```text
Index:  0   1   2   3   4
Value: [10][25][37][41][53]
Linked List
Shows a sequence of nodes where each contains data and a pointer (*) to the next node. It terminates at NULL.

Plaintext

HEAD -> [10|*] -> [25|*] -> [37|*] -> NULL
Circular Linked List
Similar to the linked list, but explicitly shows how the last node points back to the first (Head), creating an infinite cycle.

Plaintext

HEAD -> [A|*] -> [B|*] -> [C|*] --+
         ^------------------------+
Stack
Illustrates the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) concept with a vertical structure where access is only possible via the TOP.

Plaintext

TOP -> [45]
        [33]
        [12]
Queue
Illustrates the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) concept by showing the front and rear pointers to indicate where data exits and enters.

Plaintext

front -> [10][15][22][30][ ] <- rear
2. Hierarchical Structures (Trees)
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Shows the parent-child hierarchy and the ordering property: smaller values (30, 20) are on the left and larger values (70, 60, 80) are on the right.

Plaintext

        [50]
       /    \
    [30]    [70]
    / \     / \
 [20][40][60][80]
AVL Tree (Balanced Tree)
Represents a perfectly balanced subtree, where the height difference between left and right branches is minimal, guaranteeing efficiency.

Plaintext

        [30]
       /    \
    [20]    [40]
Max Heap
Shows a complete binary tree where the root node (42) is always greater than its children, illustrating the priority property.

Plaintext

          [42]
        /      \
     [35]      [23]
3. Relational Structures
Graph
Shows two perspectives:

Visual: Nodes (vertices) connected by lines (edges).

Logical: The memory representation using an "Adjacency List".

Visual:

Plaintext

a -- b
|  /|
c -- d
Adjacency List:

Plaintext

a -> b -> c
b -> a -> c -> d
c -> a -> b -> d
d -> b -> c
